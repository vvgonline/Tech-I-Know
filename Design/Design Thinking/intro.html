    <h2>Define SCRUM & Agile</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Scrum</strong> : it takes Agile principles one step further creating structure that helps the
                team in the Agile principles in their day to day work scrum is a well documented Agile framework that
                many team adopt without much disruption
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Agile</strong> : results in a team that values individuals and interactions over processes and
                tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract
                negotiation and responding to change over following a plan.
            </li>

        <h3>
            Advantages and disadvantages of scrum methodology:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Agile teams have a strong "WHY" behind what they do; also have a clarity about "HOW" they do. <a
                    href="">Agile principles</a> helps break huge and ambitious goals, work/tasks into workable chunks
                that can be delivered consistently
            </li>
            <li>
                Small teams leverage agile better over large competitors that use waterfall delivery
            </li>
            <li>
                Agile Industrial complex : lots of resources and tools are available that are needed to learn agile and
                lot more Consultants that can help in implementation
            </li>
            <li>
                Agile help steam change direction based on market and customer feedback. This is also disadvantage as
                your team can end up doing entirely different from the goal you start up from or set out to do
            </li>
            <li>
                Because of these divergent outcomes not all teams and companies can work with an Agile way
            </li>
            <li>
                But a team that can overcome this disadvantage are able to deliver a better quality product to their
                customers in the end
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>SCRUM funtions</h4>
        <p>
            In scrum a project is divided into short cycles called sprints usually lasting from 1 to 4 weeks
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of these sprints has clear goal a plan and a set of deliverables that are reviewed and tested by
            stakeholders scrum also involves a cross functional team that works together in daily meetings and a scrum
            master facilitates the process and remove any obstacles
        </p>
        <h4>Agile functions</h4>
        <p>
            Agile Delivers a software products that meet the changing requirements and expectations of the customer
        </p>
        <p>
            Agile emphasizes flexibility adaptability and continuous improvements rather than following a fixed detailed plan
        </p>
        <p>
            It also promotes teamwork communication and customer involvement rather than relying on documentations and
            hierarchy
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrum, kaban, xp, and lean implement agile approach.
        </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ships software on time. More quickly customers start using it results in more customer usage data that helps
            informing you direction and derives growth
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses sprint planning and sprint retrospective are focused on setting up teammates for success
        </li>
        <li>
            Require more resources like special roles example scrum master and a lot of refactoring around a set of
            meeting cadence
        </li>
        <li>
            Not many teams can deliver quality software thus making sprints longer. Eventually back to doing waterfall
        </li>
    </ul>
