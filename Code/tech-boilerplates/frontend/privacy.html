                            a user name, email address, and password selected by you. If you register for your Account using Social Networking
                            Service credentials, we will collect your credentials in order to identify and log into the third party application

                            <strong>Actually collected information.</strong>
                            Similar to other websites, we may collect some information automatically and store it in log files. This information does
                            not identify you. This collection may include, but is not limited to: your domain name and host for Internet access,
                            the Internet address of the site from which you came, the date and time of your access, your computer’s IP address and
                            information about its operating system, browser, and host, the date and time you access the Site and the pages you visit.
                            We collect this non-identifying information in order to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site.
                            We also use it to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We may automatically collect information using
                            the following mechanisms:
                            <div>
                                <i>Cookies.</i>
                                A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a computer for record-keeping purposes. Our third-party analytics providers
                                use cookies to record information about your activities on the Site and to “remember” you when you return to the Site.
                                Some cookies remain on your computer until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your
                                browser. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Site,
                                however certain features of the Site may not be available if your browser does not accept cookies.
                                See the section “Do-Not Track Settings” below for more information on how the Services may respond to your browser settings.
                                We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. Also see the section on “Third Party Analytics Providers” below.

                                <i>Pixels (aka web beacons/web bugs/java script).</i>
                                Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users.
                                Unlike cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of
                                the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails.
                                Our third-party analytics providers may place pixels on the Site that track what other websites you visit
                                (both before and after visiting the Site). Our third-party analytics providers use information obtained from pixels
                                to help us improve our business and the Site. We do not control the use of pixels by third parties.
                                See the section on "Third Party Analytics Providers” below.

                            If we should ever file for bankruptcy or engage in a business transition such as a merger with another company,

                            including personal information, to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

                            For example, a third party may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or other users

                    Keeping your information secure is of great concern to us. We exercise care in facilitating the transmission of information between

                    Personally identifiable information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public.
                    While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet
                    can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                    Because we track website usage information through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of
                    the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information.
                    The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage
                    the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track”
                    signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers;
                    unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last
                    or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes
                    a “Do Not Track” signal, that website may not be able to control other websites.
